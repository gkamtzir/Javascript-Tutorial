Hello and welcome to the second part of our Javascript tutorials. In this tutorial, we will be setting up our working environment. As you have probably read in the previous tutorial, Javascript does not require any particular workspace. You simply need an editor and a browser (keep in mind that in the first tutorials we are going to use Chrome's console as our working space).

You can use any editor you please. There are plenty of both free and paid versions available out there. The most popular free editors are Atom and Notepad++, while paid versions include Sublime (well, it’s kinda paid kinda free) and UltraEdit. An IDE is a powerful choice too. If you want to follow that path, take a look at NetBeans and Komondo. From all those, I prefer Atom as my editor.

Chrome is the leading browser, claiming almost 50% of the market share. Firefox and Internet Explorer are fighting head to head, claiming both an, approximately, 18% of the market share. Picking one is up to you, but I highly recommend you use Chrome, because that’s the one I’m going to use on this tutorial series.

To read through this tutorial, you don’t need any programming experience, but I’ll assume you have a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. Javascript and HTML work together. Essentially, HTML defines the page structure, CSS adds style to it and Javascript adds the functionality. As I mentioned in the first article, Javacript follows some specific rules, written by **ECMA**. These specifications are called ECMAScript. Right now, the latest version is ECMAScript 2016 (7th edition). It’s basically the same as ECMAScript 2015 (6th edition) with some extra features. In this tutorial we will use ECMAScript 5 (5th edition) and that’s because most of the web infrastructure that was built in recent years, was built on 5th edition. Don’t worry much about it. You can jump to 6th and 7th edition with ease, when you have a solid base on the specifications of ECMAScript 5.

So, setup your working environment and join me on the next tutorial, where we will start writing some Javascript code.
